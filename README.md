# React App with Node.js Backend and MongoDB

This repository contains a React application that connects to a backend Node.js server, which in turn interacts with a MongoDB database. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* Node.js installed on your local machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
* MongoDB installed and running. You can download it [here](https://www.mongodb.com/).

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-node-mongodb.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-node-mongodb
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
